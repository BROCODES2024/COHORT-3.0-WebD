Jargon to learn
static vs dynamic websites: static means nothing changes like just a html website but dynamic website is like Linkedin it keep changing
we dont need react for static websites it just increases bundle size if we use react for static website
but in case of dynamic its better to use though it increase the bundle size it gives better dev experience

- React is just an easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS. It’s a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS.
- for dynamic websites these libraries make it easier to do DOM manipulation
It’s a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS
Just how ChatGPT is an easier way to write code, React is an easier way to write HTML/CSS

problem with DOM manipulation is as the app scales it gets harder and harder to write code but with react its easier

Notes: 


1. Why React?
    - People realised it’s harder to do DOM manipulation the conventional way.
    - There were libraries that came into the picture that made it slightly easy, but still for a very big app it’s very hard (JQuery).
    - Eventually, VueJS/React created a new syntax to do frontends.
    - Under the hood, the react compiler convert your code to HTML/CSS/JS.

2. State & Components:
    - To create a react app, you usually need to worry about two things. Creators of frontend frameworks realised that all websites can effectively be divided into two parts :
        i. State
        ii. Component 

3. State / Component Re-rendering: 
    i. State : 
        - Everything in a website that changes is a state. An object that represents the current state of the app.
        - It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change).
        - For example, the value of the counter.
    
    ii. Components :
        - How a DOM element should render, given a state.
        - It is a re-usable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state.
        - This button is a component. It takes the state (currentCount) as an input and is supposed to render accordingly.
    
    iii. A state change triggers a re-render. A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated, when the state changes.

    iv. You usually have to deﬁne all your components once, and then all you have to do is update the state of your app, React takes care of re-rendering your app.

4. JSX :
    - JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML like code in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

    react component return xml not html 
    xml is similar to json

amything that starts with use are hooks ex usestate()
