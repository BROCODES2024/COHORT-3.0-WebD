Step 5 - The tsconfig file
The tsconfig file has a bunch of options that you can change to change the compilation process.
Some of these include
 
1. target
The target option in a tsconfig.json file specifies the ECMAScript target version to which the TypeScript compiler will compile the TypeScript code.
To try it out, try compiling the following code for target being ES5 and es2020
const greet = (name: string) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
//code in index.js
Output for ES5
"use strict";
var greet = function (name) { return "Hello, ".concat(name, "!"); };

Output for ES2020
"use strict";
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
2. rootDir
Where should the compiler look for .ts files. Good practise is for this to be the src folder
3. outDir
Where should the compiler look for spit out the .js files.

//we dont want to push the .js files to github or codebase we just need the .ts files
//yes we can use .gitignore but imagine there are 20 .ts files we cant just keep adding their names to the gitignore
//so solution is inside tsconfig.json make some changes
"rootDir": "./src"
"outDir": "./dist"
here dist means distribution ie it has all the js files
now create a .gitignore file and add dist over there thats it we dont need to add 20 difft js files in .gitignore
//after making these changes to run js file
use node dist/indes.js to run the code

4. noImplicitAny
Try enabling it and see the compilation errors on the following code - 
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;

Then try disabling it
5. removeComments
Weather or not to include comments in the final js file
